# ZiZoyaOS
An Operating System developed for self-learning purpose. (Still in progress...)
## Environment Requirements: (paths are required for Windows)
1. nasm - assembler for assembly code
2. qemu - CPU emulator to debug our OS
3. gcc - compiler for C code

## QEMU instruction:
In QEMU Windows version which executable files are separated, EXEs below can be used for testing:
1. qemu-system-i386
2. qemu-system-x86_64

## !IMPORTANT LOG:
1. 2020/12/21 It seems MingGW has some differences from Linux one which caused extra obstacles during developing, therefore, I decided to switch my environment to Linux in future developing. Current step: zizoya-kernel. Everything before zizoya-kernel(folder) is totally based on Windows environment.
